**Helter-skelter week**
-----------------------

Less than a month into Trump’s second term, this helter-skelter week for Ukraine policy has signaled a departure from former President Joe Biden’s pro-Ukraine agenda, stunning even seasoned observers.

The president has dispatched Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg to Europe for a series of high-level meetings. On Friday they will attend the Munich Security Conference, an international defense summit.

All the while, Trump has been making seemingly off-the-cuff remarks in Washington, telling Fox News on Monday that Ukrainians “may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday.”

This was warmly received by the Kremlin.

“A big part of Ukraine wants to be — and in fact has already become — a part of Russia,” spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday. “So this corresponds with Trump’s words.”

That kind of riffing erodes the very real base of support Trump still enjoys in Ukraine. More than half of Ukrainians now favor a swift end to the fighting, [according to a Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/653495/half-ukrainians-quick-negotiated-end-war.aspx) in November — a radical development from early in the war when such talk was taboo.

In that sense, Trump’s anti-war message has given hope to many Ukrainians, 44% of whom say they trust the president, according to a December poll by the New Europe Center, a Ukrainian nongovernmental organization whose research promotes European Union standards and practices in Ukraine.

“I think President Putin wants peace and President Zelenskyy wants peace, and I want peace,” Trump said Wednesday. “I just want to see people stop getting killed.”

Likewise, Putin has always claimed he wants an end to a war that he unilaterally started, and which has killed or injured more than 1 million people on both sides, according to NATO, including hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers.

Another 10 million Ukrainians — a quarter of the population — have fled the violence, which wiped out 30% of the country’s economy in its first year.

“Russia remains ready for negotiations,” Peskov told NBC News last week when asked what it would take to end the war. “A settlement should come as a result.”

While Putin has denied torturing detainees, state media and government officials have reported on allegations of abuses by both sides, such as a recent report by the U.N. refugee agency.

**‘World on fire’** 
--------------------

The Trump administration and its supporters respond to critics by pointing to what they say are the failed policies that produced the current crisis.

“We inherited a world on fire thanks to a generation of so-called experts from the foreign policy establishment,” Brian Hughes, a National Security Council spokesman, said in an emailed statement to NBC News. “President Trump is quickly reversing their terrible mistakes, and America is once again the dominant force for peace and stability.”

Where Trump sees a world on fire, Biden and his ilk saw an urgent need to save Ukraine.

The country can trace its roots as an independent entity  to the Middle Ages. But Putin has used [ahistorical revisionism to argue Ukraine is not a legitimate country](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-russia-ukraine-history-speech-rcna17132), annexing Crimea in 2014 and launching a full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Western nations backed Ukraine with [$130 billion of humanitarian and military aid](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/) — by far the largest slice, $88 billion, coming from the Biden administration.

That helped Ukraine’s early, stunning pushback of Russian forces bearing down on Kyiv. However, hopes of total victory have since faded, with Zelenskyy balancing gratitude for the military support with frequent statements that it’s been too little and often too late.

In recent months Russia has made battlefield advances and continues nightly missile and drone attacks against civilians and energy infrastructure.

The realities of Putin’s momentum, coupled with Washington’s volte-face, have led to a clear mood shift in Kyiv.

Zelenskyy now says that Ukraine’s territory could be regained diplomatically rather than militarily, a far remove from the war’s early days.

“Ukraine and Russia are irreconcilable, so of course there will have to be some reasonable trade-offs,” said Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense. “We need to be realistic.”

Still, many Ukrainians remain deeply opposed to doing a deal.

“There will be losses in order to keep peace — territory, people’s lives, people’s destinies,” said Baklazhov, the tortured Ukrainian who is now a deputy at the regional council in Kherson.

“Do we need such a peace plan, is the question?” he asked. “We should fight to the end.”

Title: 'Very strange': Putin's version of Ukraine's history baffles and concerns experts

Even seasoned Kremlinologists were alarmed by [Russian President Vladimir Putin's](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putin-west-new-normal-ukraine-crisis-biden-nato-rcna16617) belligerent tone as he offered a monologue on why [Ukraine](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/russia-ukraine-news) has no right to exist.

In a lengthy televised speech Monday, [Putin formally recognized the independence of two regions in eastern Ukraine](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/talk-biden-putin-summit-ukraine-shelling-rcna17033) — the self-proclaimed “Donetsk People’s Republic” and “Luhansk People’s Republic.” He later ordered troops to roll over the border under the guise of being “peacekeepers.”

Putin made no attempt to hide his motivations.

He described Ukraine as “historically Russian land” that was stolen from the Russian empire and has since fallen into the hands of neo-Nazis and corrupt “puppets” controlled by the West. The Russian president reiterated his claim that [Ukraine was subjecting Russian speakers to “genocide”](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-warns-americans-leave-ukraine-russia-troops-world-war-rcna15781) — an assertion for which there is no evidence, and which international monitors on the ground reject.

After promising to start with just "a few words about the history of this issue," he gave a lengthy revisionist account in which he claimed that Ukraine was merely a region of the old Russian empire. The modern-day country, he argued, was artificially created by Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin after the Communist revolution of 1917.

In one line that some seasoned Ukraine observers saw as an open threat, he suggested that [Ukrainians who have toppled statues of Lenin](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/icon-o-clash-ukrainian-protesters-topple-statue-lenin-kiev-flna2d11712710) were erasing their country's basis for existing.

“You want decommunization?” he said. “Very well. We are ready to show what real decommunization would mean for Ukraine.”

While Ukraine struggles with corruption and has a neo-Nazi far right, it is a democracy and the picture on the ground is nuanced. A popular uprising overthrew its pro-Russia leader in 2014, and today most Ukrainians support its path of Western integration, [polls show](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/02/18/ukrainians-support-for-joining-nato-hits-record-high-poll-a76442).

In all, Putin’s not-so-brief summary of Ukraine’s past was dismissed as revanchist and inaccurate [by historians](https://snyder.substack.com/p/kyivs-ancient-normality-redux?utm_source=url), and amounted to “a screed of ahistorical grievances,” the former chess champion and arch Putin critic Garry Kasparov [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Kasparov63/status/1495844575130308609).

Timothy Snyder, a history professor at Yale University, [told MSNBC on Monday](https://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/watch/why-invading-ukraine-could-be-a-real-problem-for-putin-133720133759?cid=sm_npd_ms_tw_lw) that Putin's take was "surreal."

"It’s very strange," he said, "when you’re surrounded by the reality of Ukrainian history, to hear a distant tyrant declare that the thing doesn’t exist. Obviously he’s wrong."

Ukraine as a modern and independent country came into being in 1991 after the fall of Communism and it ceased to be a Soviet republic.

Snyder explained that Lenin did not create Ukraine, but rather his recognition of it as a distinct Soviet republic came about precisely because he recognized there was an existing national identity that needed to be addressed.

Ukrainian nationalism went back 100 years before the beginning of the Soviet Union, and elements of Ukrainian history go back to the Middle Ages, Snyder said.

“This kind of language, that another nation doesn’t exist, is something we need to pay attention to because it usually precedes atrocious actions,” he added.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv shared a meme based on the fact that Kyiv predates Moscow as a city.

It is not clear what those actions might be. Will Russian troops remain confined to the Moscow-backed separatist regions in the country’s east, itself widely seen as a violation of international law? Or is this just the opening salvo in a broader war on the rest of Ukraine?

There are some, such as Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, a think tank, who believe that there will be “no major war.” The “stabilization of the frontline” in eastern Ukraine is Putin’s short-term goal, [he tweeted](https://twitter.com/DmitriTrenin/status/1495876724072062979).

Many other experts don’t buy that. Why would Russia mass more than 150,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders, incur Western sanctions and unite NATO — if it merely wanted to take control of a region that it has effectively controlled for years anyway?

“It suggests that this is a play for Ukraine,” [tweeted](https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1495967315292262404) Michael Kofman, a senior scientist at CNA, a nonprofit research and analysis organization based in Virginia.

The narrative is complicated by the fact Russia effectively invaded Ukraine already, in 2014.

In February of that year, masked commandos seized control of key sites on the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. After initially denying it, Putin and his officials later admitted these “little green men” were Russian forces. Moscow then annexed Crimea after a referendum widely seen as a sham.

Meanwhile, the separatists who control Donetsk and Luhansk are little more than Russian proxies, [according to international investigators](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/mh17-attack-probe-accused-4-men-murder-here-s-why-n1019586), independent analysts using open-source intelligence, and Western intelligence assessments.

They say the Kremlin has for years propped up these separatists with funds, troops and weapons, such as the Buk missile launcher that [shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July 2014](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/investigators-expected-reveal-details-mh17-plane-crash-n1019201). Russia has always denied this is the case.

Nevertheless, it’s significant that Russia is now overt about its involvement. If Moscow claims that Kyiv is firing upon the region, as it has increasingly alleged in recent days, then it would be effectively accusing it of shooting at Russian forces. There is little evidence Ukraine has done either.

Also key was Putin's announcement Tuesday that his recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk extended beyond the separatists' borders and into territory still under Ukrainian control — creating a further territorial clash.

The United States and its European allies have widely condemned Putin’s statements and promised sanctions, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saying he would halt the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between his country and Russia. But few initially called it an invasion.

“Russian troops moving into Donbass would not itself be a new step,” a senior U.S. administration official told reporters Monday. “Russia has had forces in the Donbass region for the past eight years.”

On Tuesday, however, the White House shifted its language, calling the deployment of Russian troops an “invasion,” two administration officials told NBC News.
