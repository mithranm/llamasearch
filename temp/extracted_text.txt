Java Type Casting
=================

[❮ Previous](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_data_types_non-prim.asp) [Next ❯](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_operators.asp)

* * *

Java Type Casting
-----------------

Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.

In Java, there are two types of casting:

*   **Widening Casting** (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size  
    `byte` -\> `short` -\> `char` -\> `int` -\> `long` -\> `float` -\> `double`  
      
    
*   **Narrowing Casting** (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type  
    `double` -\> `float` -\> `long` -\> `int` -\> `char` -\> `short` -\> `byte`

* * *

Widening Casting
----------------

Widening casting is done automatically when passing a smaller size type to a larger size type:

### Example[Get your own Java Server](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_server.asp "W3Schools Spaces")

```
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int myInt = 9;
    double myDouble = myInt; // Automatic casting: int to double

    System.out.println(myInt);      // Outputs 9
    System.out.println(myDouble);   // Outputs 9.0
  }
}
```

[Try it Yourself »](https://www.w3schools.com/java/tryjava.asp?filename=demo_casting_wide)

* * *

Narrowing Casting
-----------------

Narrowing casting must be done manually by placing the type in parentheses `()` in front of the value:

### Example

```
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    double myDouble = 9.78d;
    int myInt = (int) myDouble; // Manual casting: double to int

    System.out.println(myDouble);   // Outputs 9.78
    System.out.println(myInt);      // Outputs 9
  }
}
```

* * *

Real-Life Example
-----------------

Here's a real-life example of type casting where we create a program to calculate the percentage of a user's score in relation to the maximum score in a game.

We use type casting to make sure that the result is a **floating-point** value, rather than an integer:

### Example

```
// Set the maximum possible score in the game to 500
int maxScore = 500;

// The actual score of the user
int userScore = 423;

/* Calculate the percantage of the user's score in relation to the maximum available score.
Convert userScore to float to make sure that the division is accurate */
float percentage = (float) userScore / maxScore * 100.0f;

System.out.println("User's percentage is " + percentage);
```
