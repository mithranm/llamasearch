Lawyers filed fraud complaints against Argentina's President Javier Milei in criminal court for his promotion of a cryptocurrency on Friday.

MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay AP  — 

Argentine lawyers filed fraud complaints against [President Javier Milei](https://apnews.com/article/argentina-milei-trump-musk-default-economy-inflation-libertarian-18efe55d81df459792a038ea9e321800) in criminal court on Sunday for promoting a cryptocurrency on his social media, one of the lawyers told The Associated Press.

On Friday, Milei posted on X about $LIBRA, a coin that he said was aimed at “encouraging economic growth by funding small businesses and startups.”

He deleted the post a few hours later and the value of the currency collapsed, causing millions of dollars in losses to its brief investors, according to financial site Dexscreener.

The coin, developed by KIP Protocol and Hayden Davis, could be obtained by accessing a link that directed users to a website called vivalalibertadproject.com, referring to the well-known phrase with which Milei closes speeches and messages on his social media.

The President’s Office said in a Saturday statement that Milei was not involved in any stage of the cryptocurrency’s development and decided to remove the post to avoid speculation and limit further exposure, following the public reaction to the project’s launch.

Jonatan Baldiviezo, a lawyer and one of the plaintiffs, told the AP that they saw an illicit association to commit “an indeterminate number of frauds” in the episode. “Within this illicit association, the crime of fraud was committed, in which the president’s actions were essential,” he said.

Baldiviezo signed the petition with Marcos Zelaya, another lawyer; the engineer María Eva Koutsovitis; and the economist Claudio Lozano, who presided over the Argentine Central Bank during former president Alberto Fernández’s administration. Criminal justice is expected to assign a judge to the case or refer it to a prosecutor for further investigation on Monday.

The plaintiffs saw in Milei’s action an operation known in the crypto world as “rug pull.” This occurs when a developer launches an attractive token to lure investors but later abandons it after funds become overpriced, making the tokens worthless. Baldiviezo also added that Milei violated the Public Ethics Law.

“The President shared a post on his personal accounts announcing the launch of KIP Protocol’s project, as he does daily with many entrepreneurs who wish to launch projects in Argentina to create jobs and attract investments,” the President’s Office said.

**What do you think?**

After deleting the post, Milei said on X he was unaware of the currency’s development and blamed his political opponents for trying to exploit the episode. “I was not aware of the details of the project, and after getting informed, I decided not to continue promoting it (which is why I deleted the tweet),” he said.

The President’s Office said the country’s Anti-Corruption Office, which operates under the Executive Branch, would act immediately. The administration also acknowledged that Milei and members of his administration recently met with representatives of KIP Protocol at the presidential office.

“All the information gathered in the investigation will be handed over to the judiciary to determine if any of the companies or individuals linked to the KIP Protocol project committed a crime,” the Milei administration said in the Saturday statement.

Hayden Mark Davis, one of KIP Protocol’s representatives who met with Milei, blamed the president for the cryptocurrency’s collapse in a video posted on his social media on Saturday.

“Despite prior commitments, Milei and his team unexpectedly changed their position, withdrawing their support and deleting all previous posts on social media,” Davis said.

[![Image 19: MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - MAY 18: McDonald's Fawkner is seen re-opened on May 18, 2020 in Melbourne, Australia. McDonald's has closed 12 restaurants across Melbourne for deep cleaning after an external delivery driver tested positive for COVID-19. The precautionary decision to close the stores was made after a truck driver delivering supplies to the restaurants while asymptomatic later tested positive for coronavirus. All staff have been asked to self isolate not to return to work for 14 days. The restaurant closures come after the closure of the Fawkner and Craigieburn McDonald's restaurants due to COVID-19 cluster outbreak last week.

CNN  — 

[Brazil’s](https://www.cnn.com/world/americas) former President Jair Bolsonaro has been charged in connection with an [alleged coup plot](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/21/americas/brazilian-ex-president-jair-bolsonaro-indicted-over-attempted-coup-plot/index.html) to overturn the results of the 2022 election and keep his opponent from taking power, according to documents filed by prosecutors Tuesday evening.

Bolsonaro was among 34 people facing charges including those of armed criminal organization, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, coup d’état, and damage qualified by violence.

Prosecutors allege that the plot began in 2021, with an effort to undermine public trust in electronic voting machines.

In 2022, Bolsonaro allegedly met with ambassadors and diplomatic representatives to discuss the accusations of voting fraud “in an attempt to prepare the international community for disrespecting the popular will in the presidential elections,” a statement from the Attorney General’s Office read.

Despite finding no evidence of election fraud, the defendants allegedly continued their campaign to discredit the electoral system, prosecutors said.

They also allege that Bolsonaro approved a plan to carry out the coup, which they say included the death of the elected President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and his vice president.

Prosecutors said the last attempt to overturn the election happened on [January 8, 2023](https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/14/americas/brazil-congress-riots-timeline-intl-latam/index.html), when defendants allegedly encouraged groups of Bolsonaro supporters to mobilize in Brasília, where they stormed and vandalized the three seats of government.

In November, Bolsonaro and 36 others were indicted as part of an investigation into the alleged coup plot.

The charges, brought before the Supreme Court in Brasília, could set the stage for a high-profile trial. If the charges are formally accepted by the Supreme Court, those charged will formally become defendants.

To prevent the case from influencing Brazil’s 2026 presidential elections, Supreme Court justices are pushing to conclude the trial before the end of 2025, but it is unlikely the court will announce its decision on whether to take on the case or schedule preliminary hearings before early March.

In the 844-page November indictment, federal police accused Bolsonaro of having “full knowledge” of the alleged coup plan to prevent Lula from taking office, adding that the former president “planned, acted in, and led directly and effectively” the plan.

Later on Tuesday after the charges had been filed, Bolsonaro denied any wrongdoing, telling journalists he had “no concerns about the accusations, zero.”

“Have you seen the coup decree, by any chance? You haven’t. Neither have I,” he told journalists during a visit to the Senate in Brasilia, according to CNN Brasil.

According to CNN Brasil, the former president has been in Brasilia attempting to negotiate a potential amnesty deal.

If found guilty, Bolsonaro could potentially face up to 28 years in prison, according to CNN Brasil.

In 2023, Bolsonaro was banned from public office for eight years after a separate investigation into alleged abuse of power found him guilty of spreading misinformation about the integrity of the Brazilian election apparatus to foreign governments.
