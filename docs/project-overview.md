# Project Overview - LLAMASEARCH

LLAMASEARCH is an advanced search engine designed to help users find relevant content and answers based on a provided website link. Users can ask questions, and the application will use the LLAMA LLM to generate answers based on the websiteâ€™s content.

To enhance the user experience, LLAMASEARCH will offer the following additional features:

    1. Text-based answers generated by the model.
    2. A file containing citations and highlights of the content that answers the question.
    3. An audio file of the generated answer.
    4. A 1-10 rating system for evaluating the trustworthiness and legitimacy of the website/source.
    5. Pop-up feature to ask for feedback and suggestions.
